#Meteor.js

Projects, examples, and problems that I am using to practice and use this wonderful new javascript web framework. Also includes practice of React.js

* Images -  pulls from Imgur to display a list of images with title, description, and up/down votes.

* Employees - a list of employees pulled from MongoDB and served to React to render.

* Shorten - an application that shortens those pesky lengthy urls so you can share links without reaching the 140 character limit. There's also a feature that shows the number of times the link you created was clicked, os you can see your popularity.
